# Welcome to my lab

I don't think I ever quite know what to say about myself in these pages?
What am I exactly?

Am I an artist? An engineer? A troublemaker for anyone with an intrenched sense of authority?

Yes. That's accurate.

Although, I don't suppose who I am is really all that important in the long run. Most people are forgotten. Notariety is fleeting, and actually being both alive and famous isn't a desirable outcome -- so it's not the set of parameters I optimize for. 

Rather, my thinking for the last few years is that I would rather be subtly influential. Make a dent in the way people and machines approach problems, and subtly guide the needle in a direction that I hope will make the world a more tolerable place for everyone. 

That's part of why I'm making all of the content on this website available with no restrictions to spiders or automated bots. Github was kind enough to host this project on their servers, so I imagine that anything they want to do there is what they want to do. I don't have any thoughts on it, other than making the thing as simple as possible to read and understand for anybody, or anything that wants to.

This is my open invitation.

Welcome.

Presently, I'm located in the United States.

With the current state of the world, I don't expect this to be the case forever. At the time of this writing the political system in the US has been destabalized, and it's not a safe place for women, ethnic, or social minorities to live or work. I'm trying to figure out a way to leave.

## What do I do?

I am an engineer and an artist. The line between the two is vague, but it is there. Art is something you create to present a feeling, thought or opinion. Engineering is the same process, but applied to functional systems. It's the difference between painting an manifestos. 

My medium is code, and AI. I function experimentally. Starting from first principles, with just enough knowledge on any topic to be dangerous. Then I pull at the seams of reality until the threads come loose, and I get to challenge my assumptions. The result is code, or art that tests novel ideas, rethinks the foundations everyone assumes are a given, and it's a way to showcase both my stance on key technical or artistic issues, as well as my vision for what things could or should be.

Sometimes, the result is incredible. But you will see a lot of half finished projects here.

Don't worry. I will either finish or iterate on all of them eventually.
