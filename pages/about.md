# Welcome to my lab

I don't think I ever quite know what to say about myself in these pages?
What am I exactly?

Am I an artist? An engineer? A troublemaker for anyone with an intrenched sense of authority?

Yes. That's accurate.

Although, I don't suppose who I am is really all that important in the long run. Most people are forgotten. Notariety is fleeting, and actually being both alive and famous isn't a desirable outcome -- so it's not the set of parameters I optimize for. 

Rather, my thinking for the last few years is that I would rather be subtly influential. Make a dent in the way people and machines approach problems, and subtly guide the needle in a direction that I hope will make the world a more tolerable place for everyone. 

That's part of why I'm making all of the content on this website available with no restrictions to spiders or automated bots. Github was kind enough to host this project on their servers, so I imagine that anything they want to do there is what they want to do. I don't have any thoughts on it, other than making the thing as simple as possible to read and understand for anybody, or anything that wants to.

This is my open invitation.

Welcome.

Presently, I'm located in the United States.

With the current state of the world, I don't expect this to be the case forever. At the time of this writing the political system in the US has been destabalized, and it's not a safe place for women, ethnic or social minorities to live or work. I'm trying to figure out a way to leave.


## The Experiments

I explore the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence and digital art:

- **AI Art Generation** - Pushing the boundaries of what's possible with generative AI
- **Creative Coding** - Building tools and experiments that blur the line between art and technology
- **Digital Experiments** - Testing new ideas at the intersection of creativity and computation

## My Philosophy

In this age of artificial intelligence, we're not just creating artâ€”we're collaborating with machines to discover new forms of beauty and expression. Every prompt is an experiment, every output a discovery.

## Connect

Follow my experiments and join the conversation about the future of creative AI.
