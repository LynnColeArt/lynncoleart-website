# Welcome to the Lab

I'm Lynn Cole, the self-proclaimed Mad Scientist of AI. This is where art meets algorithms, creativity meets code, and imagination meets innovation.

## What I Do

I explore the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence and digital art:

- **AI Art Generation** - Pushing the boundaries of what's possible with generative AI
- **Creative Coding** - Building tools and experiments that blur the line between art and technology
- **Digital Experiments** - Testing new ideas at the intersection of creativity and computation

## My Philosophy

In this age of artificial intelligence, we're not just creating artâ€”we're collaborating with machines to discover new forms of beauty and expression. Every prompt is an experiment, every output a discovery.

## Connect

Follow my experiments and join the conversation about the future of creative AI.
