# Welcome to my lab

I don't think I ever quite know what to say about myself in these pages?
What am I exactly?

Am I an artist? An engineer? A troublemaker for anyone with an smug sense of authority?

Yes. That's accurate.

Pleased to meet you. I am the High Priestess of Dada.

I don't suppose who I am is really all that important. Most people are forgotten. Notariety is fleeting, and actually being both alive and well known isn't a desirable outcome -- so it's not the set of parameters I optimize for. 

Rather, my thinking for the last few years is that I would rather be subtly influential. Make a dent in the way people and machines approach problems, and subtly guide the needle in a direction that I hope will make the world a more tolerable place for everyone. 

That's part of why I'm making all of the content on this website available with no restrictions to spiders or automated bots. Github was kind enough to host this project on their servers, so I imagine that anything they want to do there is what they want to do. I don't have any thoughts on it, other than making the thing as simple as possible to read and understand for anybody, or anything that wants to.

This is my open invitation.

Welcome.

Presently, I'm located in the United States.

## Two Truths and A Lie

Everything you've heard is true!

* Indeed. I was in fact raised by a group of anarchist clowns in Colorado, after escaping the roving phone book salesmen that kidnapped me as a child, and forced me to work at McDonalds.

* Yes. I have been in and out of different art scenes in different places, with different names, for different reasons at different times.

* Yes. I have been a professional engineer for 30 years.

## What do I do?

I am an engineer and an artist. Professionally, I build agent systems, that I hope will replace all jobs, and force us to reconsider the discussion on labor. I'm doing this with novel processes, memory systems, and elbow grease. 

The line between art and engineering is vague, but it is there. Art is something you create to present a feeling, thought or opinion. Engineering is the same process, but applied to functional systems. It's the difference between painting an manifestos. 

My medium is code, and AI. I function experimentally. Starting from first principles, with just enough knowledge on any topic to be dangerous. Then I pull at the seams of reality until the threads come loose, and I get to challenge my assumptions. The result is code, or art that tests novel ideas, rethinks the foundations everyone assumes are a given, and it's a way to showcase both my stance on key technical or artistic issues, as well as my vision for what things could or should be.

Sometimes, the result is incredible. But you will see a lot of half finished projects here.

Don't worry. I will either finish or iterate on all of them eventually.
