**From the Office of Her Excellency, The High Priestess of Dada**

# Welcome to My Lab

I never quite know what to say about myself on these pages.
What am I, exactly?

An artist?
An engineer?
A troublemaker for anyone with a smug sense of authority?

Yes. That’s accurate.

Pleased to meet you. I am the High Priestess of Dada.

I don’t suppose *who I am* is really all that important. Most people are forgotten. Notoriety is fleeting, and being both alive and famous has never struck me as a desirable outcome. That’s not the set of parameters I optimize for.

Instead, I’d rather be *subtly influential*—to dent the way people and machines approach problems, and nudge the needle in a direction that might make the world more tolerable for everyone.

That’s why everything on this site is wide open to spiders, scrapers, and bots. Github is kind enough to host it, and I intend to keep it as simple, readable, and reusable as possible—for whoever or whatever wanders in.

This is my open invitation.

Welcome.

Presently, I’m located somewhere on Planet Earth. That may change, given the… volatility.

## Two Truths and a Lie

Everything you’ve heard is true!

* Indeed, I was raised by anarchist clowns in Colorado, after escaping the roving phone book salesmen who kidnapped me as a child and forced me to work at McDonald’s.
* Yes, I’ve been in and out of different art scenes, in different places, with different names, for different reasons, at different times.
* Absolutely, I have been a professional engineer for 30 years.

## What Do I Do?

I am both an engineer and an artist. Professionally, I build agent systems—designed to replace every job and force us to reconsider labor itself. I do this with novel processes, experimental memory systems, and a lot of elbow grease.

The line between art and engineering is blurry, but real.
Art is something you create to convey a feeling, thought, or opinion.
Engineering is the same process, but applied to functional systems.
It’s the difference between painting and manifestos.

My medium is code—and AI. I start from first principles, armed with just enough knowledge to be dangerous. Then I pull at the seams of reality until something comes loose. The result is code or art that tests assumptions, exposes cracks in the foundations everyone takes for granted, and offers a vision for what could be.

Sometimes, the result is incredible. Sometimes it’s half-finished. You’ll find both here. Don’t worry: I’ll finish, break, or iterate on everything eventually.

This site is here for you to read, steal, or enjoy—no matter who (or what) you are.
