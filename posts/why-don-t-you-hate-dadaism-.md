      You can study dadaism in school, granted. Yes. 


      And you can call yourself a dadaist, because there's no rule there that
      says you can't. In fact, historic Dadaism would want you to, regardless. 


      But implementing the philosophy is challenging. It's intentionally
      designed to go against everything you were ever taught to believe as an
      artist. Everything you accept as holy. I breaks the bullshit part of your
      brain that tells you that the rules, especially aesthetic ones, are
      important.


      The method is an incredible thing. The process of it. Giving up conscious
      control, and letting the art emerge in ways that will surprise and
      confound you.


      The contemplation of chaos and order and nothingness as you do a very
      personal kind of battle with your mind that's been trained on reason,
      morality, and other flawed but also very human ideas.


      It's more instinctual than academic, no matter how well you think you
      understand it. It's a primal kind of art that can be terrifying as much as
      it can be inspiring. 


      And you always know when you're doing it honestly.


      If more formally trained artists understood what dadaism is actually
      about, through practice, they wouldn't give it the lip service they do. 


      I met someone who seriously studied Dadaism in art school once. He HATED
      it with this intense passion. 


      As most true dada haters do, he came prepared with talking points, notes,
      and explanations. He had a perfectly valid fact based argument on why he
      thought all of it was a terrible idea! And what the negative implications
      of what dadaism actually were for art, artists, and indeed the institution
      of art itself.


      That shit is so refreshing.


      It's not a view of dadaism that I agree with.


      But it's an honest one. He did his homework and understood the philosophy
      for what it is, beyond memes and simple collages. 


      And I think that's the way more traditional artists would or really should
      feel, if more "traditional" artists were as educated on art as they
      incessantly tell you they are.


      That's rare though
