      *Does the AI discussion remind you of anything?*


      For me, it reminds me a lot of my first exposure to bad art criticism.
      When I was just a kid, there was this piece of art that we talked about at
      home a lot—Piss Christ by Andres Serrano. If you haven’t seen it, it’s
      amazing. During the 80s, it was the topic du jour, inspiring or offending
      everyone who was aware of it. My folks, who were Orthodox Jews and
      generally open-minded, were bothered by it in this intense visceral way
      that I had never seen them react to anything before.


      Suddenly, my dad, a theologian who thought Silver Age Spider-Man was the
      high point of Western artistic expression, had some really specific ideas
      of what art is, what makes art, what a valid artistic process looks like,
      and what is and isn’t acceptable to express with art, especially with
      taxpayer money. My mother was upset about this too, and she talked about
      the piece with disdain until the day she died. The thing I found really
      interesting about it, was how it wasn’t just that they had both come up
      with ideas on this topic. My parents were brilliant, they came up with
      ideas all the time. No, what was interesting here was how uninspired these
      ideas were.


      It was almost like they would open up their mouths, and suddenly it wasn’t
      even them speaking anymore. They would use arguments they heard on the
      news, without really even thinking about them seriously (a cardinal sin in
      the Jewish circles I grew up in, where critical thought is considered very
      important). And it’s not like my parents ever had this great respect for
      Christianity or Christian icons to begin with. The whole thesis of my
      upbringing, other than this moment, was to question, and be skeptical of
      anything and everything the Christians have to say. I understand why they
      felt this way, and today, I agree with them. But that’s what made this
      whole incident that much weirder.


      The whole ordeal made my eight year old mind wonder if somehow, my parents
      had been replaced by robots. Or maybe I had been replaced by a robot? Or
      maybe we were all just silly robots with little people sitting in our
      heads, in a world that disappears behind you as you walk! What even is
      reality anyway?


      How can art make someone turn their entire worldview inside-out on a dime?
      And how could I make some of that? My next memory was skipping school to
      read books on dada, expressionism, punk rock, and of course, the history
      of Spider-Man. As an adult, I understand their about-face was driven by
      this existential fear of antisemitism and what they perceived at the time
      to be a decline in the importance of religion in public discussion. Not
      per se by any kind of sincere interrogation of the piece, what it meant,
      or the need to deliver insightful critique. And the AI discussion has all
      the same watermarks and warning signs. They’ve even repurposed some of the
      same arguments, but it’s a lot bigger this time.


      My ongoing criticism of the NoAI crowd, a quirky little coalition of
      fascists, luddites, and process puritans who don’t understand art, has
      been that they started with a power dynamic that totally made sense. They
      had a topic that was really worth discussing, revolving primarily around
      data collection practices and corporate power. It’s a critique that I’m
      not really all that keen to disagree with. I do disagree with what I see
      them proposing as a radical expansions on copyright law that would turn
      artists into process accountants. That one’s beyond the pale. But
      corporate accountability in data collection? Hell yeah. There are so many
      places in our lives that would benefit from better regulations on data
      collection.


      But, see, that’s when they decided that they needed to take a stand, and
      rather than go after corporations, or lobby for new laws, they were going
      to focus primarily on attacking disabled artists, trans women, and people
      of color. And that’s pretty much everything you need to know about them,
      and the way they see the world.


      NoAI uses the institutional power of the professional art establishment,
      and their edgelord child soldiers, to harass, target, erase, dehumanize,
      and dox marginalized artists. Remember how Gamergate was supposedly all
      about “ethics in games journalism?” Same basic deal. And then, also like
      Gamergate, being the crybullies they are, they ask for empathy as though
      somehow they’re still worthy of it. There is no "both sides." Both
      sidesing this lends an air of credibility to an organized hate group,
      complete with red white and black insignia, that is both unearned and
      undeserved.


      Everybody everywhere refers to this dialectic as a “debate,” but it’s not
      a debate. Debates have rules, boundaries designed to keep things civil. If
      you ever used hate speech or intimidation to make your point, you are
      disqualified from speaking in a debate. So that’s not what this is. You
      could call it an “art criticism” movement, but you run into a lot of the
      same boundaries and limits to good taste there too, so that doesn’t work
      either. Art critics don't generally tell people to kill themselves.


      And watching the difference between the two communities is absolutely
      fascinating. One the one side, you’ve got the artists that use AI in their
      process. It’s a time of expansion, radical and rapid technological
      development, and change. There’s excitement in the air about new
      possibilities and places these new tools can go. There’s a penchant for
      surrealism and certain types of anime, discussion about the meaning of art
      and thoughtful analysis of topics in art history.


      I haven’t seen discussion about art like this since college, and it’s life
      affirming. And while there are a lot of older, more established artists in
      the space like me, there are also a lot of people who are discovering art
      creation for the first time, and finding themselves both spiritually
      enlightened and inspired in ways that simply weren’t possible before.


      Open source, community funded art AI tools empower millions of people to
      speak for the first time in a way that their voices can be universally
      heard and understood. And being here, bearing witness to this, it’s like
      nothing I’ve ever seen before.


      And then you have the other side. A lot of the leadership there is older
      artists about my age, who have never been technologists. And they’re
      sitting there, obsessively lamenting about the end of creativity, the
      coming creative apocalypse of gray goo, while directing their followers,
      (read: a lot of really impressionable kids), in the general direction of
      anything that even smells to them like it was generated by AI.


      The difference is striking in how stark it is. One side’s having a great
      time, attracting a lot of new people who are also having fun. The other is
      doing their best to stifle innovation, purity test their own people, run
      the occasional witch hunt, and target social minorities for their ire.
      Liberalism be damned, because for some reason, believing that the end of
      human creativity is upon us license to be a bigoted turd.


      You know how conservatives have this one joke that they just never get
      tired of? That’s the one that starts with, “I identify as…” and then it
      goes somewhere dark, and either leads straight into hate speech or some
      kind of absurdity that infers hate speech? Yeah, that stuff. It’s the same
      thing here.


      I think most of them are past saying “ai art isn’t art,” because,
      obviously it is, and even they understand that there’s no valid way to
      make an argument like that which is consistent with art history as we
      presently understand it. Instead, they’re making a different ahistorical
      argument. This time, it’s more specific, and doesn’t necessitate a
      complete rethinking of the validity of art in the 20th century and beyond.
      Except that it still does.


      What they want you to believe now, is that synthetic art is soulless, dead
      inside, like a blackhole that’s sucking away at you and doing other really
      bad super evil stuff. And they’re all really candid about what this is
      doing to them as people.


      One common refrain is, “AI art is destroying my appreciation of xyz type
      art!” It’s interesting, because what they’re really saying is that they’ve
      made a conscious decision to hate a particular type of art, which is
      popular in circles where artists are using ai tools. There are a few of
      these, so I’m not going to comment on any particular one. That's less
      important than the process, which is this sort of reverse osmosis effect.


      First they make a decision to hate something, then, they train themselves
      to see every flaw and error, going into great detail to scrutinize every
      piece they see, hoping in vain that they’ll be able to determine it’s
      ‘generated’ by ai. We’re going to ignore the fact that human beings can’t
      do this reliably, and just go with what they’re telling us they do.
      Problem is, that turns the dopamine receptors in your head totally upside
      down. So they’re not getting a thrill out of art anymore, even stuff
      they’ll be the first to tell you they love and respect. Instead, they only
      get excited when they can trigger hate.


      What’s worse, is that the whole thing’s in service of a bad argument that
      was won by the expressionists a hundred years ago. The spoiler is that
      art, as in, all art, regardless of process… is an inanimate object, bereft
      of meaning and soul, and any kind of human spirit on its own. It’s an
      object, a thing to be acted upon.


      A painting is just a piece of canvas with paint on it, this is true of
      every painting that’s ever been put on a canvas. A sculpture is just a
      piece of stone. A jpeg is only some computer instructions that create tiny
      dots on a screen. But you see, none of that matters, at all. Art isn’t a
      destination, but a bridge. The meaning of it, and where you find its soul…
      is in you. It’s all in how you see and appreciate the beauty you see in
      the world.


      That's the most offensive thing about these guys. How they let hate rot at
      their very being. I don't know why people aren't angry about this.


      At the end of the day, the future of art, whether we embrace it or not, is
      being shaped by AI. This new landscape is bringing more people into the
      fold of artistic expression, a fact that should be celebrated. 


      But, organized hate groups like NoAI, through their targeted assaults on
      marginalized communities, seek to undermine progress. Vainly trying to
      intimidate both newcomers as well as their own people. 


      While I’m glad that they’re starting to cope, and playing the moderate as
      often as they foil the villain role, it’s critical that we don’t let this
      kind of casual hate speech become the new face of the art world. Their
      ideas are bad, racist, transphobic, ableist, flatly objectionable, and
      runs counter to the interests of artists in every medium. Involvement with
      hate groups needs to be stigmatized.


      Together, we can put an end to the art fascism of our generation.


      Love you babies.
